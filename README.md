# Fight Youtube Addiction

If you use Chrome and watch Youtube to learn programming, then I don't care how disciplined you are, YOU NEED THIS ! Trust me, you can't fight Youtube's evil algorithmes. They will eat your life away!

By injecting CSS this very simple extension is able to block evil video recommendations from the home page, the right side bar, and the video player at the end. Making it alot easier to quit your addiction while still being able to research your tutorials or watch any specific video shared or sent to you. This is much better than totally blocking the site from hosts file or DNS.

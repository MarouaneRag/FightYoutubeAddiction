# Fight Youtube Addiction


If you use Chrome and watch Youtube to learn programming, then I don't care how disciplined you are, **YOU NEED THIS** ! Trust me, you can't fight Youtube's evil algorithmes. They keep getting better and better, and they'll eat your life away ! It's no joke.

By injecting CSS this very simple extension is able to block recommendations from the home page, the right side bar, and the video player at the end. Making it easy to quit your addiction while being able to research your tutorials or watch specific videos that are shared or sent to you. This is much better than blocking the site from the DNS or the hosts file because sooner or later we know you'll come back, it's that addictive!

To install, simply open a new tab:

- Go to  `chrome://extensions`
- Enable developer mode
- Click import extension and use the files here
- Allow extension in incognito from settings (optional)


And enjoy your new **productive** life !

You now have a competitive advantage. It's like you have mastered infinit discipline so much that nothing can distract you.

With a bit of CSS and element inspecting, you can also use this for facebook or any other source of distraction that you can't entirely block.

# Fight Youtube Addiction

If you use Chrome and watch Youtube to learn programming, then I don't care how disciplined you are, **YOU NEED THIS** ! Trust me, you can't fight Youtube's evil algorithmes. They keep getting better and better, and they'll eat your life away !

By injecting CSS this very simple extension is able to block recommendations from the home page, the right side bar, and the video player at the end. Making it possible to quit your addiction while being able to research your tutorials or watch specific videos that are shared or sent to you. This is much better than blocking the site from the DNS or the hosts file because sooner or later we know you'll come back, yeah it's that addictive.

# Fight Youtube Addiction

If you use Chrome and watch Youtube to learn programming, then I don't care how disciplined you are, YOU NEED THIS ! Trust me, you can't fight Youtube's evil algorithmes. They keep getting better and better, they will eat your life away !

By injecting CSS this very simple extension is able to block recommendations from the home page, the right side bar, and the video player at the end. Making it possible to quit your addiction while still being able to research your tutorials or watch any specific video, shared or sent to you. This is much better than totally blocking the site from DNS or the hosts file. Otherwise you'll come back.
